**Stain** — Terms of Service

*Last Updated: January 2026*

---

By adding or using Stain in your server, you agree to everything below. Don't agree? Just kick the bot.

## Rules

- Follow [Discord's Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms) and [Community Guidelines](https://discord.com/guidelines)
- Don't use the bot for anything illegal or harmful
- Don't try to break, exploit, or abuse the bot
- Don't spam commands or automate usage
- Stain is a hobby project — stuff might break, and that's not on us

We reserve the right to revoke access to anyone breaking these rules, no warning required.

## Data

We only store your **Discord User ID** and **Epic RPG stats** (hunts, adventures, coins, XP, timestamps). Nothing else.

Use `/delete` to wipe your data at any time. Run `/privacy` for the full breakdown.

## Liability

Stain is provided as-is. We don't guarantee uptime, accuracy, or anything really. Use it, have fun, don't sue us.
